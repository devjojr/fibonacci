# Fibonacci Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains Python and TypeScript implementations of the Fibonacci algorithm using three different approaches: iterative, recursive, and dynamic programming.

## Approaches

### Iterative Approach

The iterative approach uses a loop to calculate Fibonacci numbers by updating variables `a` and `b` in each iteration.

### Recursive Approach

Recursive algorithm to calculate Fibonacci numbers.

### Dynamic Programming Approach

The dynamic programming approach (memoization) uses a cache to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers.
